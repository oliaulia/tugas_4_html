        <h3>Marquez steps up recovery process in Portimao</h3>
        <p>Marc MÃ¡rquez (Repsol Honda Team) continues to step up his recovery process as the 2022 season draws ever closer. After a few days of motocross practice at the Ponts circuit in Catalunya, the eight-time World Champion took another leap forward this weekend by returning to a speed circuit, participating an invaluable private test at the Algarve International Circuit.</p> 
        <p>Having been given the all-clear following a diplopia diagnosis, the number 93 has been making steady progress in his race to be fit for the new season. He was afforded the opportunity to ride the RC213V-S road bike in Portimao, where he was joined by brother and LCR Honda Castrol rider Alex Marquez. While not quite the same machine he will be riding at World Championship events, it is a bike with which he is extremely familiar having had numerous past encounters on it. </p>
